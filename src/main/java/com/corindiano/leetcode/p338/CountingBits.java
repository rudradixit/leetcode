/**
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the
 * range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary
 * representation and return them as an array.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: 2
 * Output: [0,1,1]
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: 5
 * Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
 * Follow up:
 *
 * It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time
 * O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly
 * in a single pass?
 *
 * Space complexity should be O(n).
 * Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function
 * like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
